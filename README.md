📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

🔍 Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various customer attributes such as demographic details, account information, and interaction metrics to identify which customers are at risk of leaving a service. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model and gain actionable insights into customer retention strategies.

📂 Dataset Description

Source: Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn

Features Included:

customerID: Unique customer identifier

tenure: Number of months customer has stayed

age: Age of the customer

gender: Male or Female

contract: Contract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)

MonthlyCharges: Monthly bill amount

TotalCharges: Total bill amount

Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)




---

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Missing values identified in TotalCharges and handled using median imputation.

Correlation matrix and heatmap plotted to detect feature relationships.

Distribution plots created for continuous variables (tenure, MonthlyCharges, etc.).

Churn distribution visualized with bar charts.



---

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Missing Values: Median imputation used for numeric fields.

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler for standard normalization.

Encoding: LabelEncoder used for binary categories, OneHotEncoder for multi-class.

Train-Test Split: 80/20 ratio using train_test_split() from sklearn.



---

🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented and optimized the following models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost


Each model was tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter selection.


---

📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curve and AUC Score


🔍 Best Model: Based on performance metrics, XGBoost was selected for final deployment.


---

📊 Visualizations

📌 Heatmap of feature correlation

📌 Histogram/Distribution plots for tenure and charges

📌 Churn vs Non-Churn bar chart

📌 ROC Curves comparing all models


All plots are stored under /static/visualizations/.


---

🧠 Model Interpretability

Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model explainability:

Identified key drivers of churn like tenure, MonthlyCharges, and contract type.

Visualized SHAP summary plots and dependence plots.



---

📌 Key Insights & Recommendations

Customers with short tenure and month-to-month contracts are most likely to churn.

High monthly charges also increase churn likelihood.

To reduce churn:

Offer incentives for long-term contracts.

Provide personalized discounts for high-bill customers.

Enhance customer support experience for new users.
